Static job listings frontendmentor.io challenge

## Point to note
This is part of my 'challenges' repository which showcases coding challenges from https://frontendmentor.io. It's separate because
this particular one is built using create-react-app

My hosting website for the challenges is https://frontendcchallenges.netlify.app and you can check out this one at https://static-jobs-list.netlify.app
